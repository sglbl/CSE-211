n
(a,a)(a,b)(a,e)(b,b)(b,e)(c,c)(c,d)(d,d)(e,e)
Reflexive: Yes, all elements are present.
Symmetric: No, (a,b) is found whereas (b,a) is not found.
Antisymmetric: Yes, (c,d) is found whereas (d,c) is not found.
Transitive: Yes, (a,e) is found since (a,b) and (b,e) are found.
n
(a,a)(a,b)(b,a)(b,b)(c,c)(c,d)(d,c)(d,d)
Reflexive: No (e,e) is not found.
Symmetric: Yes, all relations are symmetric.
Antisymmetric: No, (a,b) and (b,a) are found.
Transitive: Yes, (d,d) is found since (d,c) and (c,d) are found.
n
(a,a)(b,b)(c,c)(d,d)(e,e)
Reflexive: Yes, all elements are present.
Symmetric: Yes, all relations are symmetric.
Antisymmetric: Yes, because in all (x,y) values x=y.
Transitive: Yes, because all values are like (x,x).
